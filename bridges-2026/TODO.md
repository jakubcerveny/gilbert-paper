* ~subdivision strategies, provide gilbert curve with 3 colors showing main
  subdivision scheme (fills out whitespace from main 2d subdivision)~
* eccentric subdivision:
  - provide colored subdivision alpha for 2d and 3d (to be put side-by-side)
    with constants put in
  - provide colored subdivision for in-plane 3d (to be put side-by-side)
    with constants put in
* ~don't do elementray math in main subdivision, just provide result and
  let reader do tedious calculation~
* ~clean up algorithm (2) for 3d~
  - this overflows and is way to long compared with the gilbert2d algorithm.
    I think the solution here is to put it at the end and have some graphics,
    maybe with eccentric subdivisions, on the right of it
* references
* additional pretty graphics


Consider providing harmonious comparison with in-harmonious splits
