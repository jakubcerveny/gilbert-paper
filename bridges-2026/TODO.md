* subdivision strategies, provide gilbert curve with 3 colors showing main
  subdivision scheme (fills out whitespace from main 2d subdivision)
* eccentric subdivision:
  - provide colored subdivision alpha for 2d and 3d (to be put side-by-side)
    with constants put in
  - provide colored subdivision for in-plane 3d (to be put side-by-side)
    with constants put in
* don't do elementray math in main subdivision, just provide result and
  let reader do tedious calculation
* clean up algorithm (2) for 3d
* references
* additional pretty graphics


Consider providing harmonious comparison with in-harmonious splits
