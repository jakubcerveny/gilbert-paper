  abstract = {A space-filling curve is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cell element (or pixel) in the D-dimensional space so that every cell is visited exactly once. There are numerous kinds of space-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to the one dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires knowledge of the mapping scheme provided by each space-filling curve. A space-filling curve consists of a set of segments. Each segment connects two consecutive multi-dimensional points. Five different types of segments are distinguished, namely, Jump, Contiguity, Reverse, Forward, and Still. A description vector V=(J,C,R,F,S), where J,C,R,F, and S, are the percentages of Jump, Contiguity, Reverse, Forward, and Still segments in the space-filling curve, encapsulates all the properties of a space-filling curve. The knowledge of V facilitates the process of selecting the appropriate space-filling curve for different applications. Closed formulas are developed to compute the description vector V for any D-dimensional space and grid size N for different space-filling curves. A comparative study of different space filling curves with respect to the description vector is conducted and results are presented and discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {In our previous work, by combining the Hilbert scan with the symbol grouping method, efficient run-length-based entropy coding was developed, and high-efficiency image compression algorithms based on the entropy coding were obtained. However, the 2-D Hilbert curves, which are a critical part of the above-mentioned entropy coding, are defined on squares with the side length being the powers of 2, i.e., 2n, while a subband is normally a rectangle of arbitrary sizes. It is not straightforward to modify the Hilbert curve from squares of side lengths of 2n to an arbitrary rectangle. In this short article, we provide the details of constructing the modified 2-D Hilbert curve of arbitrary rectangle sizes. Furthermore, we extend the method from a 2-D rectangle to a 3-D cuboid. The 3-D modified Hilbert curves are used in a novel 3-D transform video compression algorithm that employs the run-length-based entropy coding. Additionally, the modified 2-D and 3-D Hilbert curves introduced in this short article could be useful for some unknown applications in the future.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the global optimization problem miny∈SF(y) with S=[a,b], a,b∈RN, and F(y) satisfying the Lipschitz condition, is considered. To deal with it four algorithms are proposed. All of them use numerical approximations of space-filling curves to reduce the original Lipschitz multi-dimensional problem to a univariate one satisfying the Hölder condition. The Lipschitz constant is adaptively estimated by the introduced methods during the search. Local tuning on the behavior of the objective function and a newly proposed technique, named local improvement, are used in order to accelerate the search. Convergence conditions are given. A theoretical relation between the order of a Hilbert space-filling curve approximation used to reduce the problem dimension and the accuracy of the resulting solution is established, as well. Numerical experiments carried out on several hundreds of test functions show a quite promising performance of the new algorithms.}

We develop measures of the bounding-box quality of space-filling curves that express how effective different space-filling curves are for this purpose. We give general lower bounds on the bounding-box quality measures and on locality according to Gotsman and Lindenbaum for a large class of space-filling curves. We describe a generic algorithm to approximate these and similar quality measures for any given curve. Using our algorithm we find good approximations of the locality and the bounding-box quality of several known and new space-filling curves. Surprisingly, some curves with relatively bad locality by Gotsman and Lindenbaum's measure, have good bounding-box quality, while the curve with the best-known locality has relatively bad bounding-box quality.}

Most traditional 3D Hilbert encoding and decoding algorithms work on order-wise manner and are not aware of the difference between different input data and spend equivalent computing costs on them, thus resulting in a low efficiency. To solve this problem, in this paper we design efficient 3D state views for fast encoding and decoding. Based on the state views designed, a new encoding algorithm (JFK-3HE) and a new decoding algorithm (JFK-3HD) are proposed. JFK-3HE and JFK-3HD can avoid executing iteratively encoding or decoding each order by skipping the first 0s in input data, thus decreasing the complexity and improving the efficiency. Experimental results show that JFK-3HE and JFK-3HD outperform the state-of-the-arts algorithms for both uniform and skew-distributed data.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary
  This chapter focuses on space-filling curves and a measure of coherence. Some space- filling curves can exploit coherence in two dimensions despite a range of object area sizes. As fractals, they are self-similar at multiple resolutions. Thus, if they do a good job of visiting all the pixels corresponding to a particular object area at one scale, then they may have this advantage for much larger or smaller object areas. As topologically continuous curves, areas visited always are adjacent. Peano curves are recursive boustrophedonic patterns. They snake back and forth at multiple recursion levels, filling the plane. Because each pattern enters and exits from opposite rectangle corners, they implicitly use serpentines with an odd number of swaths, a minimum of three. Both the Peano and Hilbert curves far exceed the coherence = 1.00 measure of conventional scanline traversal. The Hilbert curve appears superior, and is easier to generate. Better performance from a real renderer can be expected simply by choosing either of these alternative traversal sequences.}

A space filling curve (SFC) is a numbering of the cells of this grid with numbers from c + 1 to c + N2, for some c⩾0. We call a SFC recursive (RSFC) if it can be recursively divided into four square RSFCs of equal size. We prove several useful and interesting combinatorial properties of recursive and general SFCs. For an optimality criterion that is important in the design of geometric data structures, we propose a RSFC that is optimal in the worst case and outperforms the previously known RSFCs.}

  abstract = {The efficiency of many data structures and algorithms relies on “locality-preserving” indexing schemes for meshes. We concentrate on the case in which the maximal distance between two mesh nodes indexed i and j shall be a slow-growing function of |i−j|. We present a new two-dimensional (2-D) indexing scheme we call H-indexing, which has superior (possibly optimal) locality in comparison with the well-known Hilbert indexings. H-indexings form a Hamiltonian cycle and we prove that they are optimally locality-preserving among all cyclic indexings. We provide fairly tight lower bounds for indexings without any restriction. Finally, illustrated by investigations concerning 2-D and 3-D Hilbert indexings, we present a framework for mechanizing upper-bound proofs for locality.}

  abstract = {In this paper we define a new compact Hilbert index which, while maintaining all of the advantages of the standard Hilbert curve, permits spaces with unequal dimension cardinalities. The compact Hilbert index can be used in any application that would have previously relied on Hilbert curves but, in the case of unequal side lengths, provides a more memory efficient representation. This advantage is particularly important in distributed applications (Parallel, P2P and Grid), in which not only is memory space saved but communication volume is significantly reduced.}
