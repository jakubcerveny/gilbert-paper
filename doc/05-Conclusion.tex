\section{Conclusion}

The Gilbert2D and Gilbert3D provide a generalization of the Hilbert curve to
arbitrary rectangular regions in to two and three dimensions, respectively.
Previous work had side length restrictions, involved complicated algorithms or lacked
easily accessible reference implementations.

The 2D and 3D Gilbert curve has similar locality metrics to the Hilbert
curve, and provides adequate run-time and memory performance
($O(\lg N)$) for enumeration and random lookup.
When a strict Hamiltonian path is not possible within the desired cuboid volume, the
Gilbert curve provides a ``best-effort'' curve, restricting the inadmissible region
to a single notch point.

Our implementation is conceptually simple, allowing for ease of implementation.
We also provide a libre/free 
reference implementation which can be downloaded from
its repository \footnote{ \label{gilbert-url} \url{https://github.com/jakubcerveny/gilbert}. }
